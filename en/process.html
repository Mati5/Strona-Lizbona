                    <p>At the beginning of their stay at the CINEL Training Center, the students were introduced  for  their trainers. They were presented with the scope of activities and the manner of organizing trainings at the host institution. They got to know the laboratories in which trainings on electronics, information technology, automation, telecommunications and other professions are organized. Then students divided into groups began classes with their Portuguese trainers. The practice began with the presentation of the rules and regulations in force at the lab and health and safety training. A program of practise and methods for its implementation were also presented.</p>
                    <p>Students continued their practise for the next three weeks. In addition, in their free time they learned the basics of the Portuguese language, they visited interesting places of Lisbon, got to know the culture and everyday life of the Portuguese.</p>
